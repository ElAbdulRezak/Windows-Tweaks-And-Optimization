# Windows-Tweaks-And-Optimization
A project created to reduce ram usage with optimization for windows 10 and 11 versions

If you want to reduce unnecessary monitoring and ram usage in the Windows operating system, you can do everything with one click.

The construction phase of this project consists of 2 months and many false attempts.

Optimization files are open source and do not contain any bad code or viruses. This is a totally user-friendly project.

If you encounter an error that will affect your Windows 10 and later operating systems, feel free to report it.

Don't forget to donate if you like my project and want it to develop further.

Operating System Requirements: Windows 10 or 11 (All Support Version 21H1,1809 and Etc..)(Windows 8 and 7 coming soon)
